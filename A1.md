First Application: AccuWeather
Link to application: AccuWeather
AccuWeather is a mobile application which uses concept of machine learning to collect, analyze and predict weather information. It gives the accurate local forecasts of weather on hourly and daily basis. Apart from this, it also shows minute-to-minute precipitation for next two hours. Similarly, this application can also predict the weather of other regions very precisely. The main reason for me to choose this novel application is it is a very commonly used application in our daily lives which actually involves real time features. This application not only reports temperature but also shows humidity levels, wind speed, dew point, pressure etc. Apart from other weather prediction applications, AccuWeather gives allergic weather prediction like dust and dander for next week also which helps people to be cautious from infecting. It has a clear user interface and proper widgets for individual category of weather reports for better understanding of the people. There are several other features like looking ahead which shows the probability of occurrence of weather like snowfall or rainfall etc. The application not only has textual representation but also has graphical and pictorial representation which attracts users. AccuWeather is informative type of application. It uses GPS, Maps, Voice search and device’s time and date to predict the weather. The features that this application has to stand unique from other weather prediction applications is we can share weather report with friends through social media or emails. This application also has recent weather-related news, videos and can also upload our videos. The weakness of this application is there is no hint hovers which shows how to navigate through the application when a new user is using it. My suggestion for the application is to provide few suggestions how to use the application because at first, it’s very confusing with lot of new data on the screens and no instructions how to navigate through the application.

First Heuristic Evaluation: User control and freedom
The application has five widgets from where we can go to branch widgets for further detailed weather information. If the user wants to move from one widget view to another view, they can directly move without any difficulty as all the five widgets appear above all the time. If the user wants to exit from the advertisements, they can disable the advertisements anytime and whenever they want. All options are available easily instead going through a long path in the application. Additionally, the application has many settings available to customize the view of the information and has many screen widget options.

Second Heuristic Evaluation: Recognition rather than recall
In the application objects, actions and options are clearly visible with just one click on the top corners. The current location and weather are shown on the top left of the main screen. All the screens are easily retrievable from any part of the application. The application has few redirecting options like ‘more details’ to view the detailed information of the respective theme. It has very user-friendly navigations to navigate through the application like viewing the news, reporting the weather, uploading videos and pictures etc. The screen widget is also available to view the current weather report instantly without opening the application.

Second Application: Waze
Link to application: Waze
Waze is a mobile application which uses machine learning and real-time data to give accurate route information or navigation, police alerts etc. It shows the required navigation for the required destination from current location or any other location. The user interface for this application has graphical view which attracts the user and makes them feel like a game view. The main reason to select this application is it has many new and advanced features like emergency alerts, nearby cheaper gas stations, food stations, police stations etc. Additionally, the application gives alert messages to get started or any emergency alerts, traffic updates and gives the fastest route to reach the destination. This application not only shows required destinations but also shows nearby coffee stores, shopping stalls, grocery stores, pharmacies, hospitals, hotels and outdoor parks etc. The main reason the user can prefer the application is it has extra features apart from navigation. The application uses geo location, device’s time and date, voice search to serve user as best as possible. The application stood unique because of the advanced features like available parking near and at the destination. The Waze application also provides facility to plan the trips with date and time and add the destinations as favorite. Similarly, the application provides many customized settings like display, sound, voice directions, battery saver, speedometer to manage vehicle speed etc. It also helps to avoid traffic routes and toll roads. The weakness of the application is it has lot of information for an individual to remember which is good thing but lot of people forget that this application provides such large amount of information. My suggestion for this application is to provide matured user interface which looks too simple as a child app and I feel like I could be more technical in language which actually is too simpler.

First Heuristic Evaluation: Match between system and real world
The application has very simple interface and language used to give the directions and alert messages. The words and phrases used in conveying alerts can be understandable to any individual. The information displayed in the application is clear and effective. The terms used in the application are quite familiar which we use in our daily lives. It also has many direct options to fulfill our requirements and has setting to customize the display. All requirements are pre-defined such that it will become easy for a new person to navigate through the application. Additionally, the application provides clear information and better usability to the new users.

Second Heuristic Evaluation: Recognition rather than recall
In the application, the user interface is clear and accurate with the precise information. The view of the application looks like a game view with bright colors which attracts user’s eyes. The instructions to use the application are clear with simple language and phrases to guide the user. Similarly, the interface provides options to navigate to any widget of the application easily. There are easy options to come back to the home screen and with just one click user can exit from the application. The options are always visible in every widget of the application. Thus, the application has good recognition rather than recall.
